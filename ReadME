1) See the package "question1" . Implemented the Sing method in Bird class
a) did the unit test in Main class bird.sing ()-- run the main "Solution" file--> you will get the result of bird method.
b)I have optimized the code by using abstract class in the interface and polimorphism concept override. which has single method name with different behaviours.
code is optimized by changing the Animal class to abstract class ( Interface contains abstract class where the method is declared but not defined).


2) Implemented Duck and chicken by inheriting the Bird class in "question1" package

3) Run the solution file "question3" package - implemented the rooster model.
a. As mentioned rooster says "cock-a-doodle-doo"
b. rooster is related to chicken by its gender.
c. used the gender variable and applied if condition to implement the rooster model in other way

4) implemented the parrot model with 3 living conditions. Run the solution file "question 4"
a)used if condition in parrotliving file
b)used if condition in parrotliving file
c)used if condition in parrotliving file
d) added two more conditions with respect to ducks and phone
